Regarding the programming fact at SZE University, the functionlibrary.cpp 
file contains every distinct function I've encountered since.

The code has been written in Visual Studio Code, and the intended structure 
of the library bases on the concept of transparency. The whole functionality 
as a categorized intel-base can be only leveraged in a code-editor
like VSCode, where the #pragma region-s are collapisble.
